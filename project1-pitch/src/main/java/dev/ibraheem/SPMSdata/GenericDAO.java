	/*- generics are a way of getting more reusability out of your code.
	 * here, i am creating the behaviors for a DAO (data access object) -
	 * an object whose job is to interact with a database. however, i might
	 * need to interact with different types of data - Pets, Users, etc.
	 * 
	 * using generics allows me to define those behaviors and then allow
	 * the specific type to be decided later. the code will look different
	 * depending on what type of objects i'm working with (Pets have different
	 * fields than Users) but the behaviors that need to happen are the same,
	 * so we can combine abstraction with generics to get the most reusability.
	 * 
	 * the generic DAO sets up the basic behaviors that we always need to be
	 * able to do when interacting with a database (CRUD methods) but leaves
	 * the type generic. we will set the type in the more specific DAOs.
	 * the "T" is short for Type but it doesn't actually matter what letter you use.
	 * sometimes you'll see K for key, V for value, N for number, etc.
	 * 
	 * the type of a generic (what replaces the T) is set at compile time. you can
	 * either set it when instantiating an object or in a subclass
